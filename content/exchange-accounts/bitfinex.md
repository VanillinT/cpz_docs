4. Label your API key and generate.  
   **IMPORTANT!** Use the keys you create only in Cryptuoso account to prevent ban from Bitfinex. It is essential that you store your API keys in a secure location and treat it like a password. Anyone with access to your API keys can take control of your account.

## Using an API Key

API keys consist of a public/private key pair, both of which must be provided to our software.

Now get to the @Cryptuoso_bot in Telegram!

You will have to copy your public & private key to your account. Go to _Main Menu -> Settings -> My Exchange API Keys_

Fill in your 2 API keys.

#### Youâ€™re done! Once your funds arrive, your bots start trading. If you don't have any active bots go to "Robots" section.
