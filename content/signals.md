### ⚠️ Use all signals and robots at your own risk. ⚠️

Be careful with trading size and remember that the more profit you want to take the more loss you can get.  
One of the key things is not to hurry with increasing trading size.  
Try to diversify your trading using different strategies or coins.

**⚠️ Please keep in mind that the commission is not yet taken into account in any statistics!**

## What is signal robot?

Signal robot is an algoritm that analyzes the current situation on the market and generates trading signals.

## What is signal?

Signal is a recommendation to buy or sell currency at determined price.
Our signal robots will give you the signal when it is better to open and close position and what position to take. You just need to follow the recommendation of signal robots.
All signals based on algorithms that tested on history and work in real-time **more than 2 years**. You can study the results of each signal robot.

## How can I use it?

The signals go out once or 3 times a day at the same time so it’s easy to follow manually. Just repeat the orders (buy, sell or stop/limit orders).  
It’s **important** to place an order in advance, because you can skip the necessary moment.

You can use signals in 2 different ways:

- Choose the signal robots you want and manualy follow the recommendations on your crypto excahnge.
- Use the signals as additional filter to you own crypto trading system.

## What are the advantages of using a signal robots compared to manual trading?

- Signal robots not experiencing emotions and strictly following the algorithm.
- Trading is conducted on tested conditions with a predictable result.
- Trading with signal robots is simple to use for beginers and non-professional traders.

**Max Consecutive** - the maximum number of consecutive winners and losers generated.  
**Maximum Drawdown** - the greatest peak to valley decline in the equity.  
**Profit Factor** - the absolute value of the gross profit divided by the gross loss.  
**Recovery Factor** - the absolute value of the total net profit divided by its maximum drawdown.  
**Payoff Ratio** - the average percentage profit per trade divided by the average percentage loss per trade.

## How to calculate the volume for trading?

To calculate your trading volume use this simple formula:

> **your trading balance** / **number of robots** = **trading volume for one robot**

For example, you have an account with balance **1000 \$** and you want to subscribe on **10** robots,

so **1000 \$** / **10** = **100 \$** for each robot

Of course, you can allocate more volume to one robot than to another, but in total you **should not exceed the size of your funds**.

Ok, you want the robot to trade **100 \$**.
Just divide **100 \$** on desired **cryptocurrency price** and you will get the volume for robot to trade.

For example 1 ETH is worth **200 \$**.

So your trading volume for ETH/USD robot will be
**100 \$** / **200 \$** = **0.5 ETH**.

Just enter the received volume while subscribing to new signal robot and you can start trading by following signals.

## How often the signals appear?

- The robots with “8h” in name have maximum 3 signals a day (every 8 hours).
- The robots with “1d” in name have maximum 1 signal per day.

## What is Long/Short?

**Long** is when we **buy**cryptocurrency and hope that it’s price will **rise**. So we will sell it at higher price and get a profit.  
**Short** is when we **sell** cryptocurrency (and we didn’t buy it before) and hope that it’s price will **fall**. So we buy it back at lower price and realize a profit.

## How to understand signals and what to do?

There are 2 type of messages:

- 🚨 **New Signal!** means the price at which you should make the trade in the future.  
  The signals can be both for opening and closing the position. You can just place the stop order at this price and wait for it execution or new next signal.

When next signal is appeared and previous order is not executed - cancel previous order and create a new one.

- 🚨✅ **New Signal Trade!** means the buy/sell market trade.
  If you see in 🚨✅ **New Signal Trade!** only entry (Entry: **SELL ⬇️ (Short 🔴)** or Entry: **BUY ⬆️ (Long ✳️)** - it means that robot opened new position.  
  For copy this action you just need to buy or sell at the same price.  
  If you also see in "New Trade" exit (Exit: **SELL ⬇️ (Close Long ✳️)** or Exit: **BUY ⬆️ (Close Short 🔴)** - it means that robot closed the position. You should do the same.
  Also if there was 🚨 **New Signal!** with **Stop** ⛔ order type and same position code before the 🚨✅ **New Signal Trade!** just confirms that that signal was successfullY completed. You don't need to create a new market order for it.

## What does stop order mean and how to use it?

A stop order is used to trigger a market sell when the market drops to your trigger (stop) price, or used to trigger a market buy if the market rises to your trigger (stop) price.

It's better to read the FAQ on your exchange about order types and how to use them.

Example for _Bitfinex_:
We have the signal:
Action: **BUY ⬆️ (Long ✳️)**
Order type: **Stop** ⛔
Signal time: 2019-10-16 08:00 UTC
Price: 3.0687

What should you do:

1. Open Bitfinex terminal.
2. Choose the required cryptocurrency in Tickers window.
3. Then under the Tickers window you have Order form.
4. Choose margin, then stop order.
5. In the field stop price place the price from the signal (3.0687). In the field amount choose the amount of cryptocurrency you want to trade.
6. Click Margin Buy cause we have in signal “Action: BUY”.
   In the middle you will have the window Orders where you will see this order. You can cancel or modify this orders with the buttons on the right.

On _Kraken_ you should go to New order window, then choose advanced. The fields are the same. But on Kraken you need to choose the leverage for margin trading.

Every exchange has a bit different interface for creating orders and trading so you should learn the user manual of your exchange.
