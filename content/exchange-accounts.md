## What is an API key?
An API key is the bridge between a Software (Cryptuoso Trading App) and your Exchange. The API key allows to make deals and monitor positions on you account.

## Why does Cryptuoso need API keys?
* Read out the actual information about coins prices.
* Ask the exchange about you portfolio status for account statistics
* Send buy and sell commands to your exchange automatically

By using this API key, we do not require any Login information of your exchange, nor can we withdraw any funds (Make sure to never enable withdrawal rights in your API keys. As this allows companies to withdraw funds. We explicitly do NOT want these rights.)

## How can I create API keys?

## What should I do with API keys?
After you have created an API key, you can fill it into your account settings [fill in your API key here](www.cryptuoso.com)

If all goes according to plan, your API key should now be filled in into your account. Make sure that you have a subscription running! Otherwise the robot will not act.
