### ⚠️ Use all signals and robots at your own risk. ⚠️

Be careful with trading size and remember that the more profit you want to take the more loss you can get.  
One of the key things is not to hurry with increasing trading size.  
Try to diversify your trading combining different strategies or coins.

## What is robot?

Robot is a program that analyzes the current situation on the market without human participation according to a laid algoritm.

## What are the advantages of robot?

- Reacts to events much faster.
- Doesn’t get tired and works 24 hours and 7 days a week.
- Not experiencing emotions and strictly following the algorithm.
- Can make a large number of transactions with different instruments.
- Can wait weeks and make a deal at exactly the right moment.

## How to calculate the volume for trading?

For example, you have an account with balance 1000 $  
You want to subscribe on 10 robots.  
The simple formula looks like _balance / number of robots (1000 / 10 = 100 $ - volume for each robot).\_ Of course, you can allocate more volume to one robot than to another, but in total you should not exceed the size of your funds.  
Ok, you want the robot to trade 100 $. Just divide 100 $ on desired cryptocurrency price and you will get the volume for robot to trading.  
Just enter the received volume in the "trading volume" window for the robot and push the "start" button.
