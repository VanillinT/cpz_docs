**Recovery Factor** - the absolute value of the total net profit divided by its maximum drawdown.  
**Payoff Ratio** - the average percentage profit per trade divided by the average percentage loss per trade.

## How to calculate the volume for trading?

To calculate your trading volume use this simple formula:

> **your trading balance** / **number of robots** = **trading volume for one robot**

For example, you have an account with balance **1000 \$** and you want to subscribe on **10** robots,

so **1000 \$** / **10** = **100 \$** for each robot

Of course, you can allocate more volume to one robot than to another, but in total you **should not exceed the size of your funds**.

Ok, you want the robot to trade **100 \$**.
Just divide **100 \$** on desired **cryptocurrency price** and you will get the volume for robot to trade.

For example 1 ETH is worth **200 \$**.

So your trading volume for ETH/USD robot will be
**100 \$** / **200 \$** = **0.5 ETH**.

Just enter the received volume while adding new robot and you can start trading.
